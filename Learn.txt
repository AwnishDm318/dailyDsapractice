1) Matrix traversal, how can we use matrix first row and coloumn as a extra space and use its information for changing in matrix.
   like, I solve in set-matrix zero problem, where i use first row and coloumn inforamtion for compution.
 2) I also learned how to form matrix with only row by solving pascal triangle.
    // here is the code..
     vector<vector<int>> matrix(numRows);
        
        
        for(int i=0;i<numRows;i++)
        {
            matrix[i].resize(i+1);
            matrix[i][0]=matrix[i][i]=1;
            for(int j=1;j<i;j++)
                matrix[i][j]=matrix[i-1][j]+matrix[i-1][j-1];
        }
        return matrix;
 3)I had learned kadanes algorithm.
 4) Little bit aboutbinary search tree (creation && insertion opertation)
5)merge sort
